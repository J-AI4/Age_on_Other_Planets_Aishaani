Overview:

The Age on Other Planets is a calculator that tells you how old you would be on other planets in our solar system. You just need to type your age on Earth and press calculate. Then, you'll instantly see your age on Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 

Why I Made This:

Iâ€™ve always found space fascinating, and I wanted to build something both fun and educational. Most calculators online felt overwhelming, and didn't have the vibe I was going for and I got a vision in mind, so I decided to make my own.

How It Works:

I built this tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you type in your Earth age, it calculates your age on other planets by dividing it by each planet's orbital period around the sun. For example, to find your Mars age, it takes your age (for example, 15) and converts it to days (15 years old x 365 days in a year = 5475 days old), then divides that number by a Mars year (in Earth days: 687), so 5475/687 = 7.97 (rounded to the nearest hundreth). 

How to Run:

1. Download all the files (index.html, style.css, script.js) and make sure they're in the same folder.
2. Open index.html in any browser.
3. Type in your age and explore your planetary self!

What I Learned and Struggled With:

The biggest challenge was balancing aesthetic design with functionality. I had to spend sometime finding the colors I liked, and experimented with different layouts to find the one that I had envisioned. Calculating accurate planetary age was also tricky, and I went back to my science class knowledge from middle school to find some details (such as how many Earth days each planet year had). Making sure the math worked using the data and adjusting for accuarate results took some time. Through this project, I became more confident in using JavaScript for real-time calculations, handling form inputs, and refining design with CSS.

Notes: 
This project was built by me using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm open to feeback, improvements, ideas and suggestions!
